#### Service App

I did not have time to add all of the required functionality but the application can send and recieve requests. It also includes:

- Responsive Login/Register Form
- Utility functions for user authentication and verification
- Allows the user to enter the name of a seller for reviews

#### Run Application

To run the application, unzip the zip and extract it to any location. Navigate to the location you extracted the zip using a terminal. 

Enter the following commands from the terminal

```
npm i
```

```
cd service-app
```
Then

```
npm run dev
```
This will run both the development server and nodeJS server in parallel

#### Missing Dependencies 

You can install missing dependencies with one command 

```
npm-install-missing
```

Make sure to install the package globally first

```
npm install -g npm-install-missing
```
